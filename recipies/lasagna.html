    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oreagno</li>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>12 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large skillet, cook and stir ground beef until brown. Add onions
        and garlic, cook until onions are transparent. Add tomato sauce, tomato
        paste, salt, and oregano. Simmer for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain
        noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta
        cheese with egg, parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13
        inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread
        with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of
        mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella,
        and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with
        remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent
        sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil
        does not touch the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an
        additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your lasagna!</p>
